\
META-DATA\
\
colorID: color band combination\
status:territory holder or floater\
sac_date: date the bird was sacrificed\
studyyear: field season\
last_behav: last date before sacrifice when the bird was recorded on the leks (i.e., in the proximity system)\
diff: time difference in days between sacrifice date and the last date when the bird was recorded on the leks\
\
TESTOSTERONE METRICS\
\
final_corrected_T: corrected T (from Ryder et al. Am Nat) from the final blood sample taken immediately prior to sacrifice\
mean_T: mean T (from Ryder et al. Am Nat), which is the best estimate of among-indiviudal variation in circulating T across the entire study\
\
RAW BEHAV. METRICS... these are the raw daily behavioural metrics, integrated (averaged) across different timescales that may be of interest\
\
effort.all_study: mean number of pings per 10-hour day, using all days when the bird was recorded on the leks, across the whole study\
strength.all_study: mean number of social interactions per 10-hour day, using all days when the bird was recorded on the leks, across the whole study\
degree.all_study: mean number of social partners per 10-hour day, using all days when the bird was recorded on the leks, across the whole study\
ndays.all_study: the number of days that the bird was recorded on the leks across the whole study\
effort.sac_year: mean number of pings per 10-hour day, using only days within the breeding season when the sacrifice took place (i.e., the most recent recording session)\
strength.sac_year: mean number of social interactions per 10-hour day, using only days within the breeding season when the sacrifice took place (i.e., the most recent recording session)\
degree.sac_year: mean number of social partners per 10-hour day, using only days within the breeding season when the sacrifice took place (i.e., the most recent recording session)\
ndays.sac_year: the number of days that the bird was recorded within the breeding season when the sacrifice took place (i.e., the most recent recording session)\
effort.last_day: number of pings in the last recorded day before sacrifice\
strength.last_day: number of social interactions in the last recorded day before sacrifice\
degree.last_day: number of social partners in last recorded daybefore sacrifice\
ndays.last_day: 1\
\
ADJUSTED BEHAV. METRICS... these are daily behavioural metrics that have been statistically adjusted for annual and temperature-based variation (in a log-normal model), then the residual values were integrated (averaged) across different timescales that may be of interest (parallel to above) \
\
ADJ_effort.all_study: mean residual number of pings per 10-hour day, using all days when the bird was recorded on the leks, across the whole study \
ADJ_strength.all_study: mean residual number of social interactions per 10-hour day, using all days when the bird was recorded on the leks, across the whole study\
ADJ_degree.all_study: mean residual number of social partners per 10-hour day, using all days when the bird was recorded on the leks, across the whole study\
ADJ_effort.sac_year: mean residual number of pings per 10-hour day, using only days within the breeding season when the sacrifice took place (i.e., the most recent recording session)\
ADJ_strength.sac_year: mean residual number of social interactions per 10-hour day, using only days within the breeding season when the sacrifice took place (i.e., the most recent recording session)\
ADJ_degree.sac_year: mean residual number of social partners per 10-hour day, using only days within the breeding season when the sacrifice took place (i.e., the most recent recording session)\
ADJ_effort.last_day: residual number of pings in the last recorded day before sacrifice\
ADJ_strength.last_day: residual number of social interactions in the last recorded day before sacrifice\
ADJ_degree.last_day: residual number of social partners in the last recorded day before sacrifice}
