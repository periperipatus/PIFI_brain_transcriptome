# Neurogenomics of cooperative behavior in the wire-tailed manakin

This website contains supplements to the word document-based supplementary material. It includes the markdown documents of the code I used to do the analyses, and the full figures and code can be accessed on the github repository itself.

Please note that the GO annotation methods are not in Rmarkdown. The code used can be found [here](https://github.com/periperipatus/PIFI_brain_transcriptome/tree/main/GO_annotation).
