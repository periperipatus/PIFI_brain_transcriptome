This repository contains the workflows for the *Pipra filicauda* (Wire-tailed Manakin, family: Pipridae) neurogenomics of cooperative lekking behavior.

This website houses the workflows I arrived at for the analysis of the brain and endocrine RNAseq data. The website is viewable [here](https://periperipatus.github.io/PIFI_brain_transcriptome/). It is intended as a companion to the Supplementary Materials document.

The repository branch ["analysis_code"](https://github.com/periperipatus/PIFI_brain_transcriptome/tree/analysis_code) houses the Rmarkdown documents necessary to make this website, as well as the STAR mapping script.
The [main branch](https://github.com/periperipatus/PIFI_brain_transcriptome/tree/main) houses the data, outputs and the GO annotation process. 

Please NOTE: This project uses R v4.0.2
